            <h3>A Brief Introduction to Go</h3>
            <p>According to legend, Go was invented around 2300 BCE by Emperor Yao. His son, Danzhu, was proud, arrogant, and impulsive, so Emperor Yao invented Go to cultivate his son's character.</p>
            <p>Go uses black and white stones, with the player using black stones playing first. The two players alternately place black and white stones on the intersections of a 19x19 grid board. Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved or removed. The objective is to surround territory and capture the opponent's stones, with the winner determined by the size of the territory controlled.</p>
            <p>The rules of Go are simple and elegant, yet the gameplay is incredibly complex and varied. Mastery requires extensive practice and study. Chess grandmaster Emanuel Lasker praised Go, saying, "If there are intelligent beings on other planets, they almost certainly play Go." Go is considered one of the most complex board games in the world, with its complexity proven to be PSPACE-hard by Robertson and Munro in 1978.</p>
            <p>As of mid-2008, there were over 40 million Go players worldwide, with the vast majority in East Asia. By the end of 2020, the International Go Federation had 77 member countries and five association members.</p>

            <h3>Modern Go</h3>
            <p>After the Meiji Restoration, Go players lost the support of the shogunate and began seeking new ways to make a living. This led to the emergence of newspaper-sponsored Go tournaments and the modern ranking system, as well as the establishment of the national Japan Go Association. During the Showa era, Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru initiated the "New Fuseki" movement, marking the beginning of modern Go. Subsequently, many top players emerged in Japan, such as Sakata Eio, Fujisawa Hideyuki, Takagawa Kaku, and later players like Otake Hideo, Ishida Yoshio, Takemiya Masaki, and Kobayashi Koichi.</p>
            <p>In 1989, Korean player Cho Hunhyun won the first Ing Cup World Go Championship, sparking a Go craze in Korea. Following this, numerous world Go tournaments were established. In these tournaments, Korean player Lee Changho emerged as the leading player of his time. After 2006, Lee Changho's performance began to decline, and new talents like Lee Sedol and Gu Li started challenging his dominance. The subsequent years saw intense rivalry between Gu Li and Lee Sedol.</p>
            <p>In the 2010s, many Chinese players rose to prominence, with young players such as Jiang Weijie, Fan Tingyu, Shi Yue, Mi Yuting, Chen Yaoye, Zhou Ruiyang, and Tan Xiao winning consecutive world championship titles.</p>

            <h3>Go Culture</h3>
            <p>Over the thousands of years that Go has been played, a multitude of terms have emerged. Some of these terms have even entered common vocabulary, such as "endgame." Almost every move in Go can be expressed with specific terminology, and it is possible to describe an entire local battle using these terms. For example: "Black occupies the star point in the upper right corner, White makes a small knight's move approach, Black plays a two-space high pincer, White jumps one space, Black follows with a jump, White makes a small knight's move into the corner, Black blocks at the 3-3 point..." This passage vividly describes a common joseki using Go terminology. Some common terms include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Atari: When a stone or group of stones has only one liberty left, it is said to be in "atari."</li>
            <li>Liberty: The empty points adjacent to a stone. A single stone can have up to four liberties, but connected stones can have more. Playing on the opponent's liberties is called "tightening liberties."</li>
            <li>Capture: Stones with no liberties are removed from the board. Capturing the opponent's stones is referred to as "capture."</li>
            <li>Point: The empty points on the board surrounded by a player's stones are called "points."</li>
            <li>Territory: The total number of points surrounded by live stones plus the live stones themselves is called "territory."</li>
            <li>Empty Space: The area enclosed by stones.</li>
            <li>Ko: A situation where both players can alternately capture each other's stones. According to Go rules, the player who is captured in a ko cannot immediately recapture; they must make a move elsewhere to create a ko threat before they can recapture.
                These terms and concepts are essential for understanding and discussing Go strategy and gameplay.</li>
