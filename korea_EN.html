            <p>The Korea Baduk Association (Korean: 한국기원) is the governing body for professional Go in Korea. Its history can be traced back to November 1945 when Cho Namchul founded the Seoul Go Institute.</p>
            <p>Cho Namchul traveled to Japan in 1937 to study under Go master Kitani Minoru, a 9-dan professional. He returned to Korea in 1945 and established the Go institute. Traditionally, Koreans used the Shusaku opening method, but after establishing the Korea Baduk Association, Cho persuaded Koreans to use the white stone for the opening move. In 1956, the National Go Championship was founded, promoting Go competitions to the public.</p>

                <h4>Cho Namchul</h4>
                <h5>Cho Namchul (Korean: 조남철, November 30, 1923 – July 2, 2006) was a South Korean professional Go player, regarded as the father of modern Korean Go.</h5>
                <p>In 1946, Cho founded the Seoul Go Institute, marking the official beginning of professional Go in Korea. In 1950, under Cho's organization, Korea held its first modern Go ranking competition. Cho was ranked as a 3-dan, while others were ranked as 1-dan. However, the Korean War broke out just days later, and Cho was drafted into the military. The Seoul Go Institute was destroyed during the conflict.

                    In 1955, Cho persuaded South Korean President Syngman Rhee to organize a delegation of professional Go players to Taiwan for an international match against local players. The Korean team won, boosting the morale of the Korean people and bringing Cho and modern Go into the spotlight. Subsequently, several professional Go tournaments were established in Korea. The Seoul Go Institute was rebuilt in 1968 and renamed the Korea Baduk Association.
                    
                    Cho dominated the Korean Go scene throughout the 1950s until he was eventually surpassed by Kim In, who returned from studying in Japan. In 1983, Cho was awarded the rank of 9-dan. In 1994, he reached the main tournament of the National Go Championship, becoming the oldest player to do so. His nephew, Cho Chikun, supported by Cho Namchul, went to study in Japan and later became one of the top players in the Japanese Go scene.

                <h4>Cho Hunhyun</h4>
                <h5>Cho Hunhyun (Korean: 조훈현, born March 10, 1953) is a South Korean professional Go player and a 9-dan rank holder in the Korea Baduk Association. He is a nine-time world champion and a pioneer of modern Korean Go, earning him the title of "Emperor of Go."</h5>
                <p>Cho Hunhyun is the mentor of Lee Changho, the record-holder for world Go championships, and the two are collectively known as the "Cho-Lee Teacher-Student Duo." Along with Yoo Changhyuk and Seo Bongsoo, they are referred to as the "Four Kings of Korean Go," who dominated the global Go scene from the 1990s to the mid-2000s.

                    Born in Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, Cho became the youngest professional player in the history of the Korea Baduk Association at the age of 9 years and 7 months in 1962. In 1963, he went to Japan to study Go under the tutelage of Kitani Minoru and was re-ranked as a professional in Japan, achieving 5-dan in 1972. He returned to Korea due to mandatory military service, where he formed a close friendship with renowned amateur player and gambling king Cha Minsu during his service.
                    
                    After his military service, Cho initially planned to return to Japan but decided to stay in Korea after fierce competition with Seo Bongsoo, a 9-dan professional. Cho eventually emerged victorious in their rivalry and became the dominant player in Korean Go, winning over 130 domestic titles. He was promoted to 9-dan in 1982.
                    
                    In 1989, Cho defeated Chinese Go master Nie Weiping in the first Ing Cup with a 3-2 victory, sparking a Go craze in Korea and becoming a national hero.

                <h4>Lee Changho</h4>
                <h5>Lee Changho (Korean: 이창호, born July 29, 1975) is a South Korean professional Go player born in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. He is considered the second-generation leader of Korean Go and one of the greatest Go players in modern history, often compared to Go Seigen, with the saying, "In 20th century Go, there was Go Seigen in the first half, and Lee Changho in the second half."</h5>
                <p>
                    Lee became a professional player at the age of 11 in 1986, second only to Cho Hunhyun, who became a pro at 9. In 1992, at just under 16 and a half years old, he won the Tong Yang Securities Cup, still holding the record for the youngest world champion in Go. In 1996, the Korea Baduk Association granted him a direct promotion to 9-dan. Lee has won every major title in Korean domestic tournaments and achieved a Grand Slam in international Go competitions. His prime years in the international Go scene were from 1992 to 2012, with 1996 to 2006 recognized as the "Lee Changho era." Throughout his career, he has won 17 world championships and 21 international titles, both records that remain unmatched.
                    Lee Changho is not only a master of individual competitions but also a hero in team matches. His unyielding determination led to 14 consecutive victories in the tri-nation Go tournaments, serving as the final player in 9 matches with a total record of 29 wins and 7 losses. Korean Go fans honor him as the "Guardian God," while Chinese and Japanese fans refer to him as the "Iron Gate" in recognition of his defensive prowess.

                <p>
                    Lee Changho, along with Cho Hunhyun, Seo Bongsoo, and Yoo Changhyuk, is known as one of the "Four Kings of Korean Go." He is also part of the "New Four Kings" with Lee Sedol, Park Younghoon, and Choi Cheolhan. Due to similarities in age, name pronunciation, and domestic success with Chinese 9-dan Chang Hao, the two are often referred to as the "Twin Stars of Go." However, in terms of international success and head-to-head records, Lee Changho has consistently outperformed Chang Hao.

                <h4>Lee Sedol</h4>
                <h5>Lee Sedol (Korean: 이세돌, born March 2, 1983) is a South Korean professional Go player with a 9-dan rank. He grew up on Bigeum Island, Sinan County, South Jeolla Province, earning the nickname "Bigeum Island Boy." Due to his remarkable early career performance in domestic competitions, he was also called the "Undefeated Boy." As the third-generation leader of Korean Go, he is often mentioned alongside Lee Changho as "Big Lee and Little Lee." Along with Lee Changho, Park Younghoon, and Choi Cheolhan, he is one of Korea's "New Four Kings." He is also known as one of the "Twin Stars of Go" alongside China's Gu Li. Lee Sedol has won 14 world championships and 18 international titles, ranking second only to Lee Changho.</h5>
                <p>
                    Lee's prime period was from 2002 to 2012. Early in his career, his playing style was sharp and aggressive, excelling in large-scale battles and earning the nickname "14-dan" for his mid-game prowess, although his opening was considered weaker. As he matured, his style evolved into a more versatile approach, adept at both offense and defense, becoming a master of the game. His style is known for its deceptive and unpredictable moves, often making surprising and ingenious plays, leading fans to describe his style as "zombie Go" due to his ability to revive seemingly dead stones and turn the game around.

                    Lee Sedol is renowned for his psychological resilience, frequently making comebacks in critical world championship matches. From 2005 to 2010, his rivalry with China's Gu Li attracted significant attention, with their matches being evenly contested.

                    In 2016, Lee Sedol famously played a five-game match against Google's AI program AlphaGo. Although he lost the series 1-4, his victory in one of the games demonstrated that humans still had the potential to challenge and defeat AI. This match was a landmark event in the history of Go and AI.
