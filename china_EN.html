        <h3>China Qiyuan</h3>
        <p>
            The inauguration ceremony of China Qiyuan was grandly held on March 15, 1992. Construction of China Qiyuan began in October 1988 and was completed after more than three years. China Qiyuan is a public institution directly under the State General Administration of Sports and serves as a comprehensive training base and competition venue for Chinese board games. It directly manages the national teams for Go, Xiangqi (Chinese chess), and international chess. Additionally, it organizes various major domestic and international competitions in these three games and promotes various community-based board game activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In November 2019, the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the State General Administration of Sports (China Qiyuan) was designated as the protective unit for Xiangqi, a national intangible cultural heritage representative project.

        <h3>China Weiqi League A</h3>
        <p>
            In its inaugural year, the China Weiqi League A had only ten teams participating, each playing 18 home and away games. In subsequent years, the league expanded to twelve teams, with each team playing 22 home and away games. Each club can field 4 out of 6 registered players for matches. Players are not limited to those affiliated with the China Qiyuan; many foreign players from Korea and Japan also compete in the league, even in League B.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottom two teams in League A are relegated to League B, while the top two teams from League B are promoted to League A. Since 2006, the league champions from China and Korea have competed in a champion's match.
