            <h3>Go is a strategic board game that uses a grid board and black and white stones for gameplay. It originated in China, where it was historically known by various names such as "Yi," "Qi," and "Shou Tan."

        <h3>About Haifeng</h3>
        <p>
            In 1997, Mr. Lin Wenbo, driven by his love for Go, decided to donate 30 million TWD to establish a foundation dedicated to promoting Go. After consulting with Go master Lin Haifeng, who fully supported the initiative and agreed to serve as the first chairman, the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" was established, embarking on its mission to promote Go.

            Organizing both professional and amateur tournaments requires significant financial and human resources. Over the years, the Haifeng Foundation has grown rapidly, thanks to continuous funding from Chairman Lin Wenbo. However, the foundation still faced challenges in organizing professional competitions, necessitating organizational adjustments. Consequently, Chairman Lin decided to merge the "Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation" with the "Peisheng Cultural and Educational Foundation" to achieve a synergistic effect greater than the sum of its parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Peisheng Cultural and Educational Foundation, another family-donated foundation led by Chairman Lin Wenbo, has long been engaged in special education work. With more abundant resources than the Haifeng Foundation, the merger allowed the Haifeng Foundation to gracefully conclude its mission, passing the torch of promoting Go to the Peisheng Foundation. The staff of the former Haifeng Foundation was reorganized to meet the needs of Go promotion, forming the "Haifeng Go Academy," which continues to be actively involved in the front-line efforts of promoting Go.
